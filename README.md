# Install Packages with Dependencies

Given a list of packages with dependencies, list the order of installation so there isn't a fail due to a missing dependency.

## Getting Started

```
git clone
```

If you use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):
```
yarn install
```
```
yarn run start
```

If you use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):
```
npm install
```
```
npm run start
```

The output of this program is to `stdout`.

## Data
